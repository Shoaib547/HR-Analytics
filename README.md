### HR Analytics Dashboard

![HR Dashboard](HR_Dashboard.png)

In this project I have created an HR Analytics dashboard using PowerBI Desktop.

The steps followed are:
- Loading data into Power BI and cleaning it with Power Query
- Creating HR metrics like headcount, avg. salary, avg. leave balance etc.
- Finding relationships between salary and education qualification
- Using visual filters to see top paid staff in each job
- Customizing visuals in Power BI (changing colours, axis, labels and legend)
- DAX calculations like cumulative headcount, leave balance more than 20 days
- Designing a monthly HR dashboard with Power BI

Using this dashboard, we can find the following:
1) How many people are in each job?
2) Gender break-down of the staff
3) Age spread of the staff
4) Which jobs pay more?
5) Top earners in each job
6) Salary vs Qualification
7) Staff growth trend over time
8) Employee filter by starting letter
9) Leave balance analysis
